<h2>Rubric for homework grades in STATS/DATASCI 531, Winter 2021</h2>
  
Each homework will receive a numerical score on the following scale. In addition to a numerical score for each homework, you should expect some comments on things that could be improved in future work.
<p>
10. Answers are clearly written and correct. It is clear what sources were used, for what purposes, and what was done independently. So far as sources were consulted, the solution shows thought going beyond borrowing from the source.
<p>
9. A strong solution, but with minor issues and room for improvement. Perhaps there are minor technical errors. Perhaps mathematical notation is used poorly, or with inadequate explanation. Perhaps, sources are given but not clearly referenced where they are used. Perhaps some parts of the solution do not contribute beyond the referenced source. 
<p>
8. Multiple or more serious minor issues, as described in (9).
<p>
7. A major issue. Perhaps a substantial part of a question is missing or badly wrong. Perhaps sources are missing: it is important to be explicit if no sources are used, and usually you can at least explain what parts of the notes or textbook you referenced.
<p>
6. Multiple or more serious major issues, as described in (7).
<p>
5. Homework completed but of inadequate quality to pass a Masters level course.
<p>
0. The grader carries out detective work and concludes that uncited sources likely played a significant role in the homework. One particular example is verbatim copying of any part of the solution from any uncited internet source. You are welcome to appeal a 0 score if you think it has been assigned in error. We keep open eyes to maintain the integrity of the course but we are happy to find out if our suspicions are wrong.
